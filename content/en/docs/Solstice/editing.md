## Medical Operation Through Which I Am Unfazed by Your Frequent Distance
  
Processional forgetting onsets upon arrival to the home of just myself.  
I wipe clean my memory of your touch, the point of your gaze.   
We meet for the first time again and again—*o, how long it’s been*.  
You cross your legs and I watch where your feet land.  
Had I not been lobotomized, I’d be screaming  
*I wish you’d miss me.*

Misery loves company and so please join me  
in my exile of withdrawal and rumination on  
inches that should have been removed and  
minutes that should have been there, too.

My body can no longer withstand this operation  
in such proximity, at such frequency.  
Our weeks close in on each other,  
we touch less than ever.

I want to remember your friend that overdosed and  
the way you sit when you drive—naked and assuming.  
I want to remember the title of every book,  
the name of every philosopher, the writing  
on post-it notes, the quotes on mugs.  
I ask you to a movie—the most heinous act of all.  
How lucky are you for the luxury of choice?  
I want to spend the night with nobody else.  
I only want to come home to you.  
There is no other satisfaction,  
and, erasure, even as it guts me.

Withholding as punishment for absence  
is a vast miscalculation of my weakest spots.

If you were so ivy league,   
you’d not throw your overpower   
into complaints for compliance—   
_I’d just be there._

I am too old to follow anger home.  
I am too old to feign naiveté.

If you saw me in three dimensions, you’d run and I’d laugh.

I’m so strong that it would make you fucking blind.   
I’m so strong that I won’t show you.  
I'm so strong that I throw a little fit when you put me down.  
I'm so strong that I only silently collapse.   
I'm so strong that I shave my stomach and my asshole,  
that I laugh when you say you want to buy me Invisalign  
and force me to smile with only my good teeth.
## Non Rom Com Reminders of a Love So Absolute

the touch of love  
tenders my soul  
in the sweetest way, today  


how often i am profoundly changed  
each time i am grounded


is it so scary to be loved absolutely?  
i look for it in other places.

is it so scary to be absolutely loved?  
what if i am not my best?  
you would still love me,  
and that hurts worse.

i want to be my best for you,  
i want to outgrow my growing pains,  
i want to love you through growth spurt hurt  
like you love me even when my hurt hurts you,  
[because, i am still growing]

it's just that you've never stopped raising me  
and it's making me go blind.

i see bright reds and muted  
pinks and sunshine yellows,   
i feel your solar warmth,  
your blinding brightness  
that burns my skin until  
it peels and i am left  
with this greyed baby blue,  
this waiting room purple, that  
paints and pours through my body,  
drowns me from the inside,  
consumes me whole, and spits me   
into the pit where [i now know]  
i must sit to assess the damages,  
to put the bones back together,  
to climb out and realize  
that the pit was a wall,  
that i am closer to the sun than ever  
that soon i will burn again.

do you remember when we  
went to the emergency room  
because a swimming pool  
reflection of the sun  
gave my hands burns  
blistered like tree trunks?  
it was so uncanny.  

they gave me valium  
and i became so flippant  
that you pleaded me  
to never do drugs,  
which i did &amp; do,  
which is okay because  
you did &amp; do more than me,  
which reminds me that i  
am a seed you planted,  
worked for,  
loved absolutely.

I am rooted in you, and while I am not afraid  
of sneaky sunburns or opioid addiction,  

_I am afraid of my flippancy,  
and I am afraid of how it hurts you._

I want to outgrow my growing pains, but I cannot face my final fear.

context for you:  
it's all because i told her that i couldn't sleep in my bed so i've slept on my couch for the past week and as if she had not spent enough on my education and bad credit / attitude, to her own deficit, she came into my home and gave us (my home and i) love like she'd never given, life like it was all she had, and maybe i didn't really realize how badly i need my mother's touch. i am surrounded by so much softness now that i think i will never wake up; i think i may decidedly keep dreaming this exact moment until i am jolted awake with no memory that it happened, either because you forget dreams upon waking or because i will be so waiting room purple that the memory could shatter me to bits. i hope it is because you forget dreams upon waking or because there are new dreams that demand a bit more space [and rightfully so] and given the aforementioned, is poetry a dream journal? in these matrifocal poems, you [not reader, but maker] create me and want me to be something you can revel in, subsequently i lock myself in my sometimes metaphorical room [also done by you], and i lie, and i lay in made-up agony, for a decade, then i turn today years old and you've made my heart into an open wound in the most torturously and naturally beautiful way i think anybody could, and with my spilled guts i create something that i can revel in, that i wish i could give back to you. birth and pain and art and death. it is the truest life cycle, but it is not true to us, even though you would be so proud to hear that I haven't written about a man's love in months, but I can't tell you that, because now my poetry is full of your name, and endings, and feeling small and afraid. and then maybe you'd be proud all over again, because I've pushed through my need for distraction from limitations to get to the core of it, to get to the really gritty part where i start to get pity that i don't want, people telling me they don't know what to say and in return i will scream on our rooftop. i will not lie down. i will not let it change my shape.

_won't it feel so ridiculous when none of this ever comes true,  
to have fixated my renaissance upon loss?_
