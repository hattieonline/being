## The Eve
Hattie is typing.

I’m not sure where to began, but I’m not sure if I ever have. 

We open where it all starts. A dining room table where my aunt conducted her existence, a bud-vase centerpiece from my grandma stocked full of dead flowers that still have the audacity to be colorful. A craft beer at 3:00 PM, an Ensure at 8 AM, and another right now, because I forgot how badly I want to take care of myself. I do. I do. Oh god, I do.  

The captain has been yanked out of her sinking ship, the one she swore she’d die on, the one she swore she wasn’t drowning alongside. You don’t know your disarray until you are looking at it from above— some heavenly place where you’re floating in all white, saved by some God that has the same name. You’re looking over a shoebox diorama full of red strings, beer cans, tip toes, weed resin; and you realize you were never able to translate that existence into the pain it really was, something you never could have realized until whatever death grabbed you by the neck ascends you to posthumous glory. The death that will happen a million times over, if you’re lucky. 

## The Day
**What I wanted to say to you is that life feels like a sick fucking joke.**  

You would tell me that it isn’t, and I would reluctantly agree, because we both know about pain and the directions it expands in that we will never fully grasp. We all have pain, it’s all a little different, but in all situations it is still just that-- pain. It is through pain that we grow, and as living creatures on the earth, we must grow. There are corners to turn and homeruns to hit and knees to scrape. Men to harass you, apartments to move, illness to catch, cancer to — whatever.  I still smile, we all still smile, and in all endings, everything turns out okay. Nothing is for naught. 

The world will eat at us, but we grin as we grow as we gripe as we’re low. 

We endure for tenacity's sake. The richness that lives in our lessons learned. Today, I feel smug about my various rock bottoms, which taught me to have faith that in a year I’ll look back on whatever rocky water and how little I knew about the growth it would catalyze. You just don’t know when it’s coming. I’ll weather any storm but be no less scared of it. Even then, I still wish for the rain. 

I hope my mom doesn’t have a new cancer growth. I hope I didn’t give her a virus when her white blood cell count is so low that she can’t leave the house in the first place, and she can’t get off of her chemo to give the count a chance to rise, because of the potential cancer growth. What if she dies while I am in isolation, and I can’t be there, and the last text she ever sends me is “ok” and there are so many good parts left that we never get to have, and I don’t get to make peace with that? I feel it in the front of my stomach, pushing itself down on my gut and flittering through my lungs and shoving its fist up my esophagus, punching out my throat.  

I promise I won't play in the ache competition. If I *had* told you that life feels like a sick fucking joke, or that it is unfair to specifically me, I’d just be being dramatic, like I always am.

I’m above everything, in trees I still haven't had the chance to greet, and I will be here for five days, roaming my treehouse, getting high, sitting still, trying to swallow. Unseen, unsaved, unsettled. There is no distraction. There doesn’t have to be. Do you think if I practice a very intentional solitude, I will struggle with it and persevere, and come out on the other side knowing something valuable and important?

My dad carried a microwave and groceries up four flights of stairs and gasping for breath, red in the face, he asked me how I’m feeling. I was too nervous to speak because I thought I would sound too healthy compared to his hyperventilation, and he'd think he has had made this physical sacrifice for naught. And I mostly don’t wanna look at him because his panting compassion feels vulnerable, and now I have this microwave and foods he knew I would like that he purchased even though I did not ask for them. 


To be loved wholly and without artifice,  
never a stipulation, never a transaction.  
To be cared about, tended to, fought for,  
to receive love that is just an _“of course”_

This love is so big and bright and indisputable,  
I can hardly bear looking at it in the face.


**Here’s a conversation I just had:**

**Me:** Well, it’s just you and me now.  
**Me:** Finally. I love when we retreat into each other. I love ending my night with you.  
**Me:** You’ve had a hard day, and it’s your birthday, and you’ve got COVID, and your mom is having new cancer issues — this is a hard day. you’ve been tough, even if you don’t feel that way. How can we take care of you?  
**Me:** I don’t want to take care of myself. I don’t want you to take care of me.  
**Me:** I love you. I just want you to feel better. You’ll feel better when you’re clean. When you get yourself sorted. There’s still time in the day for it to be a little better.  
**Me:** You’re right. I’d like to shower. I’d like it to be a really good one.  
**Me:** What makes a shower good?   
**Me:** I don’t know. 

Sometimes I reference a list I made for best shower best practices that I spent hours researching before a company holiday party. Once, I got high and had a good one. The rest of the times I showered high I was afraid I was being watched. Sometimes I think the trick is to remember you’ll never have it figured out. Expecting a period of peace will always bite you. Such is life. 

I can’t really eat the birthday cake because of my cavities, but I suppose we will keep each other comfortable.

## The Days Following
#### A day
Last night, I learned how to lucid dream,  
and we soared through the streets.  

You still didn’t remember how much you meant to me,  
so I yanked us out and over to the moment,  
in which I never realized how uncomfortable  
my open heart surgery made you feel. 

I'm sorry.

#### Another day
This morning, I woke up without anything to prove.  
I did some mulling over and didn't daydream about you,  
as another graduation, just today on my walk, as I do.

The trees gathered round me, to lean across the hall   
to touch each others spirit fingers, like parents  
after a middle school championship sports game won.  
 
Today we celebrate the rain and  
how it made for a stream  
you cannot help but listen to.  

The stride in my walk,  
the swing dance in my arms,  
the rushing, the onslaught, the   
washing over of contentedness.  

The consummations of a lesson learned.  
The remembrance of the idle mind.  
The unsung fun of undemanded attention.

I ruined another idea by turning it into an Adderall sonnet today,  
an act of martrydom in the name of disjecta membra poetae
