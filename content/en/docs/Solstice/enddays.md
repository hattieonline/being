### you, infiltrator of premises or routine,

i wanted     
to write you   
a letter  
to say  

_how i think letters would make you happy  
which me, makes happy, and as would reading  
out loud. i always want to practice, and now you and  
yet now you. then now you. but now you. i have to read  
every love poem written to compare now holiest you  
to the stars  and then give it back. and now you. now  
you i have to reread all my old words to imagine now   
you imagining me, in a different life, begging   
to know my now you and i didn't even know of the    
breadth or the excitement and do you wanna make pasta?_   

i am threatened  
by abandon  
in every  
good way  


### tell me you'll

how happy you when  
 we held hands to exit  
you felt like what maybe  
i daydream about tell me  
it was the best part tell me  
when you hear my name tell me  
what do you feel? you love my feet  
they're dirty but by no means unloved  
i'm dirty i found it in my mom's search   
history of unlove they're dirty i am but i   
am un abashed loved by best contestant  
you? will you? try? they're calloused you  
don't mind. but i've been places? could we try?

### exit the game
to turn hot blood into teenage angst and  alcohol  
requires at least all vulnerability left in the threads.  

i don’t have it.   

i don’t have the composure, the ability  
to withhold when you need it the most.  

and so, congratulations:  
you broke down the flood barriers  
and I’m coming inside.  

for a coffee, for a glass of wine,   
for appraisal, for a sleepover with   

you tell me of skips in your step  
upon my name, witnessing it  
on me, witnessing it. on my being,  
witnessing it. and then you not of course 

flee the scene, blame the floodgates  
rue them and remove them and remove   
you and ever having been the maybe happy  
ending. i'm sorry.   

i got too excited. i can’t write like i once did or like     
i expect but then maybe i expected you but can you   
blame me? i blame you, blame your idealization and   
devalue me because i gave in, because your fuck you  
removal. you wanna read my writing?  
i won't speak.  

six months from now i will forget you  
unlike what you said it’d be   
six days from now i will forget you   
unlike some weekend plan with me     

is it cuz i was barefoot?  
is it cuz of the chewed up gum?  
is it the drugs?  

i’ll stop in the name of   
love but not yours
