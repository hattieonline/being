## Event Log at the Escapist Palace

1.	We sit on the precipice.  
Behind us the earth pushes forward—slowly, carefully,  
only when we aren't looking.  

2.	On my back is a vortex, and the whole world enters in pairs.  
Two turkeys, two doe, two bucks, two babies,  
and the two of us, bewildered and searching. 
3.	God lives in the ground here, and each of us knows this is true.  
We kiss it with whatever our mouth looks like today.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine: a hand opened, and head bowed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours: gentle eyes that fall to your knees when the time is right.  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is always right. We hold hands and succumb in tandem.

4.	A million beds and we three still sit in the corner of one.  
We take turns dripping mirrors, checking if we’ve turned into our mothers yet,  
getting each other high, giving vigilante justice, and grace, and grace, and good god, grace.

5.	Waist deep with danger swimming around my legs, I realize it no longer matters.  
The ocean crashes into me until my only thoughts are strategies for moving over, under, and through. My body is one with. There are no true minutiae. There never was.
6.	We lose the need for lists once encountered with the epiphany that order is for naught. Lights on a switchboard with no rhythm and never an end, you are a flash then nothing then everything in an instance. I am never afraid of the last time I see you. 
7.	Mourning is ingrained into our days, and we are thus jubilant.  
We welcome the end and brace for the beginning, over and over, knowing we will never coexist with the final conclusion and in that, we are melded together for finite forever. 
8.	We laugh at our own hurt feelings when the hummingbirds perform their dance.  
At their apex, our putrid insides roll away. We float into the emptied middle place where we have never been, and yet always are. 
9.	There are no wildflowers because that is not the nature of this.  
The animals do not have enough to eat and houseless chimneys blink back at me—it is not about the beautiful end. It is surviving to the bitter one. 
10.	We enter the houses of all strangers.   
We leave strands of our hair on pillows and in shoes.  
This is how you circumnavigate our new homes, and   
this is my desperate attempt for prolonged isolation.   

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be taken away forever.   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be stripped of my days and left at the mouth of rocky waters.   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you to come, too.   
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My exile will rebirth me, where will you be?
